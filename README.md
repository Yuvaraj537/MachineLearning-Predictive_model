## 📌 1. Machine Learning Types

Machine Learning is broadly divided into:

1. **🎯 Supervised Learning**  
   - Training data has input features **X** and output labels **Y**.  
   - The model learns a mapping function `f(X) → Y`.  
   - ✅ Example: Predicting house price, disease detection.  

2. **🌀 Unsupervised Learning**  
   - Data has **no labels**.  
   - The model finds hidden patterns or groups.  
   - ✅ Example: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.  

3. **🎮 Reinforcement Learning (RL)** *(optional extension)*  
   - Agent learns by interacting with an environment.  
   - ✅ Example: Self-driving cars, game playing bots.

### 📊 Popular Classification Algorithms & Explanation  

#### 1. **Logistic Regression**  
- Despite its name, it is used for **classification** (not regression).  
- Uses the **sigmoid function** to output probabilities between 0 and 1.  
- ✅ Example: Predicting whether an email is spam (1) or not spam (0).  

#### 2. **Decision Trees**  
- A tree-like structure where each node splits data based on feature values.  
- Final predictions are made at **leaf nodes**.  
- ✅ Example: Medical diagnosis (disease vs no disease).  

#### 3. **Random Forest**  
- An **ensemble of decision trees** where the final prediction is made by majority voting.  
- Reduces overfitting and increases accuracy.  
- ✅ Example: Fraud detection in banking.  

#### 4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- Finds the **best hyperplane** that separates data points into classes.  
- Can handle both **linear and non-linear** classification using kernels.  
- ✅ Example: Face recognition, image classification.  

#### 5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- Classifies a new data point based on the **majority class of its k nearest neighbors**.  
- Simple but computationally expensive on large datasets.  
- ✅ Example: Recommender systems, customer segmentation.  

#### 6. **Naïve Bayes**  
- Based on **Bayes’ theorem** with the assumption of feature independence.  
- Works well for **text classification** tasks.  
- ✅ Example: Sentiment analysis, spam filtering.  

#### 7. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**  
- Ensemble method that builds models sequentially, correcting previous errors.  
- **XGBoost** → Extreme Gradient Boosting (fast & efficient).  
- **LightGBM** → Faster training, good for large datasets.  
- **CatBoost** → Handles categorical features well.  
- ✅ Example: Customer churn prediction, loan default prediction.

### 📊 Popular Regression Algorithms & Explanation  

#### 1. **Linear Regression**  
- Assumes a **linear relationship** between input features (X) and output (Y).

- ✅ Example: Predicting stock market prices.  

#### 5. **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**  
- Uses **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for regression tasks.  
- Fits the best line within a margin of tolerance (epsilon).  
- ✅ Example: Predicting real estate prices with fewer errors.  

#### 6. **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**  
- Adds a **penalty term** to linear regression to reduce overfitting.  
- Formula: `Loss = (Y - Y_pred)^2 + λΣ(w^2)`  
- ✅ Example: Handling multicollinearity in financial datasets.  

#### 7. **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**  
- Similar to Ridge but uses **absolute values** of weights.  
- Can shrink some coefficients to zero (feature selection).  
- Formula: `Loss = (Y - Y_pred)^2 + λΣ(|w|)`  
- ✅ Example: Selecting important features in high-dimensional datasets.  

#### 8. **Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)**  
- Builds models sequentially, each correcting errors of the previous one.  
- Uses decision trees + gradient descent optimization.
